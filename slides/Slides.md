## Two Views of AI

| Groupthink Pessimist | Intentional Optimist |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Using AI because I have to keep my job | Using AI to amplify work I enjoy |
| AI will replace me | AI will enhance me |
| AI is a threat to creativity | AI is a catalyst for creativity |
| AI makes me less human | AI helps me be more human |
| AI is taking over | AI is empowering us |


> "The future isn't something that happens to us. It's something we create together."

## Reframe # 1 : AI as a Thought Partner, Not a Boss

🤝 From fear to **possibility**

💡 From control to **co-creation**

🎷 From orchestration to **improvisation**

## Reframing # 2 : AI As Mirror rather than Machine

AI is a Mirror of Our Mindset:

- Our fears manifest as limitations
- Our curiosity unlocks possibilities
- Our need for control transforms into partnership

When we change how we see ourselves,
we change what's possible with AI.

💭 "AI doesn't just show us technology - it reflects our own potential back to us."

## Barriers AI Can Break

| Past Limitation       | AI Augmentation       |

| Fear of being wrong   | Instant feedback       |
| No time               | Fast first drafts      |
| Can't code            | Natural language tools |

   - Brainstorming, writing, expanding ideas

2. 📚 **Learning with AI**  
   - Customized learning, Azure tutorials

3. 🛠️ **Creating with AI**  
   - Projects, tools, content that once felt out of reach
