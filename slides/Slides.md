## Two Views of AI

| Groupthink Pessimist | Intentional Optimist |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Using AI because I have to keep my job | Using AI to amplify work I enjoy |
| AI will replace me | AI will enhance me |
| AI is a threat to creativity | AI is a catalyst for creativity |
| AI makes me less human | AI helps me be more human |
| AI is taking over | AI is empowering us |

[  : break out into 1 per slide. Ask question for raised hands, get interaction, build repoire.
Get social proof for possibility versus fear based answers]

## A Story of Possibility

100 years ago:
- No personal computers
- No internet
- No smartphones

Yet someone dared to imagine...

> "Every person could have a computer in their home."

They were called dreamers. Unrealistic. Impractical.

## The Ember of an Idea

You have something to express:
- A story that needs telling
- A tool that could help others
- A vision of what could be

But the voice says:
- "I don't have the skills"
- "I can't compete with the pros"
- "Who am I to try?"

## From Survival to Creation

### The Old Story
- "I need to protect my job"
- "I need to keep up"
- "I need to survive"

### The New Story
- "I can amplify my creativity"
- "I can explore my ideas"
- "I can create what matters"

## Your Crossroads Moment

🔄 We're at an inflection point:

**Path A:** Stay in survival mode
- Keep up with AI
- Protect what you have
- Watch others innovate

**Path B:** Embrace co-creation
- Partner with AI
- Express your vision
- Shape the future

## That Ember Inside You

Remember that idea you had?
The one that made you think:
*"If only I could..."*

Now you can.

> "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."

What will you create?

## Reframe # 1 : AI as a Thought Partner, Not a Boss

🤝 From fear to **possibility**

💡 From control to **co-creation**

🎷 From orchestration to **improvisation**

## Reframing # 2 : AI As Mirror rather than Machine

AI is a Mirror of Our Mindset:

- Our fears manifest as limitations
- Our curiosity unlocks possibilities
- Our need for control transforms into partnership

When we change how we see ourselves,
we change what's possible with AI.

💭 "AI doesn't just show us technology - it reflects our own potential back to us."

## 3 Realms of Co-Creation

1. 💭 **Thinking with AI**  
   - Brainstorming, writing, expanding ideas

2. 📚 **Learning with AI**  
   - Customized learning, Azure tutorials

3. 🛠️ **Creating with AI**  
   - Projects, tools, content that once felt out of reach

## Prompt Example

🧪 "I have a dream to build _____, but I am blocked by fear of _______. I believe in _______. Talk me through seeing this in a way that turns the fear into excitement. "

➡️ Iterate. Refine. Publish.

## Intentionality Is Everything

⚖️ Tech is neutral.  
💫 Direction comes from **intention**.
