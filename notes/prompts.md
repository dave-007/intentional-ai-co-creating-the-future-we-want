A surreal, cinematic landscape showing a forked road under a dramatic sky. The left path leads to a dark, oppressive dystopia: towering gray megastructures, robotic enforcers, people walking in lines with emotionless faces, skies filled with surveillance drones, cables entangling buildings like vines. Colors are cold—blues, grays, harsh reds. The atmosphere feels heavy and controlled.

The right path leads to a vibrant, harmonious future: humans and AI working together in open, collaborative environments. Lush green landscapes, clean architecture with soft curves, warm sunlight, holographic interfaces in use by smiling people, robotic assistants helping children and elders, creative labs with art and invention. Colors are warm—golds, greens, soft blues. The feeling is uplifting, free, and alive.

At the fork stands a human figure in silhouette, choosing between the two. Light spills from the flourishing side, while shadows loom from the dystopian side. The composition should evoke choice, contrast, and possibility.
