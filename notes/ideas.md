 ðŸŽ¤ "Intentional AI: Choosing Wisdom Over Fear"

Are we embracing AI out of hype, or are we using it with purpose? David will break down how to navigate AI adoption with intentionâ€”unlocking creativity and productivity without letting fear take the wheel.

- AI makes more possible, we can create more, if we are willing to learn and experiment.
- We might think AI will do things for us, make us less. But as we embrace the possibilities we contain and can create, AI can make us MORE.
- Analogy of humans and fire, our evolution is not separate from our relationship with fire.
  - Carry forward to internet, the free exchange of ideas and services enables us to embrace the ideas and relationships that most resonate with us
