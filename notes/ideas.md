 ðŸŽ¤ "Intentional AI: Choosing Wisdom Over Fear"

Are we embracing AI out of hype, or are we using it with purpose? David will break down how to navigate AI adoption with intentionâ€”unlocking creativity and productivity without letting fear take the wheel.

- AI makes more possible, we can create more, if we are willing to learn and experiment.
- We might think AI will do things for us, make us less. But as we embrace the possibilities we contain and can create, AI can make us MORE.
- Analogy of humans and fire, our evolution is not separate from our relationship with fire.
  - Carry forward to internet, the free exchange of ideas and services enables us to embrace the ideas and relationships that most resonate with us

TODO: tell the journey story, theme of me matters more
TODO: Conversation I most want to have is with that person with the ember of an idea they could express with AI, but stuck in survival mindset but pushing at the borders. ASK CHATGPT for the compelling story. (100 years ago we didn't have xyz, someone had an idea and made it happen. we're at a crossroads, huge leap, if we go pessimist we miss out.)
My version of this story.

I am meant to challenge beliefs that keeps other people stuck.
Turn the pressure into permission to see things differently, to use AI differently

HOW DO I SEE THIS AS A SOUL NOT A SLIDE DECK (Avatar)
Create a 'future ready human'
Help them, meet them at their reality and show them another possibility, hold both truths so can connect and respond
CODED FOR Storytelling, Inspiring, not tech programmer
PRACTICAL AI 101 / chatgpt/claude, etc AFTER showing the possibilities
PAID SPEAKING GIGS -> Different type of transformations (learn ropes with free speaking)
Give self more grace & HUMOR when correcting, suffering is part of a story I tell, optional (not facing dragon)
defined spleen - processing the world's fear (57/20?) - transmuting it for everybody, not just me
people I serve, fear of spekaing up at work, stepping out of technical role, etc, here's what worked for me
whatever folks' framework is, chatgpt can acknowledge that frame of reference and help them reframe.

Notes: 

I'm here to have a conversation about the possibilities YOU (avatar) see with AI. I am here to support you on this journey.

i've got to have the conversation (listen & understand), not just transmitting amazingness. How do they want it, individual, group, tech/hands-on, certs, building something?

For the two view of AI slides:

[  : break out into 1 per slide. Ask question for raised hands, get interaction, build repoire.
Get social proof for possibility versus fear based answers]
